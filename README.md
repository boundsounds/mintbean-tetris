  This project uses React and Redux to recreate the classic arcade game Tetris.
  
  By the end of this project, I was able to familiarize myself with...

    Implementation of an advanced multi-page application with React
    Using Redux to manage application state
    Building systems that manage and merge complex arrays
    Using functional programming methods like map
    Using CSS variables
    Creating complex layouts with CSS grid
   
   
   # Directions 
   Use the buttons on screen or the keyboard arrow keys and spacebar to
        move, rotate and drop the shape into place!
